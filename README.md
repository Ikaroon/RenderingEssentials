### Worley 2D Textures
1. Create a new texture asset from `Create>Worley 2D Texture`
2. Expand the Worley field and adjust the values
   - Seed: A random value that allows for persistent values
   - Point Count: How many points to use for the worley generation
   - Radius: The relative maximum radius of worley points
   - Inverted: Should high value be close to points instead of far away
   - 
### Worley 3D Textures

2. Expand the Worley field and adjust the values
   - Seed: A random value that allows for persistent values
   - Point Count: How many points to use for the worley generation
   - Radius: The relative maximum radius of worley points
