## How to use
### Gradient Textures
1. Create a new texture asset from `Create>Gradient Texture`
2. Use the gradient field of the texture and apply

### Gradient 2D Textures
1. Create a new texture asset from `Create>Gradient 2D Texture`
2. Use the gradient 2D field of the texture and apply

### Worley 2D Textures
1. Create a new texture asset from `Create>Worley 2D Texture`
2. Expand the Worley field and adjust the values
   - Seed: A random value that allows for persistent values
   - Point Count: How many points to use for the worley generation
   - Radius: The relative maximum radius of worley points
   - Inverted: Should high value be close to points instead of far away
